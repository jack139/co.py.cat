=========

This repository has an implementation of [Douglas Hofstadter](http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/)'s copycat algorithm in Python. 

It is an [analogising](https://www.wordnik.com/words/analogize) [algorithm](https://www.al-got-rhythm.net), and explained [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycat_%28software%29). It is the foundation of a group of similar algorithms [metacat, musicat, seqsee, ...](https://github.com/Alex-Linhares/FARGonautica).

This implementation is a copycat of Scott Boland's [Java implementation](http://itee.uq.edu.au/~scottb/_Copycat/), but re-written into Python3. It's not a direct translation, more like "based on a true story". I did not carry over the GUI, as [GUIs restrict the platform](https://www.slant.co/topics/983/~best-cross-platform-gui-toolkits) too much, and thought that this code could more usefully be imported by other Python packages.

In cases where I could not grok the Java implementation easily I took ideas from the [LISP implementation](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mm/how-to-get-copycat.html), or directly from [Melanie Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanie_Mitchell)'s "[Analogy-Making as Perception](http://www.amazon.com/Analogy-Making-Perception-Computer-Melanie-Mitchell/dp/0262132893/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1351269085&sr=1-3)"

I keep trying to make the code "more pythonic".

Installation
------------

There are no particular installation instructions, just clone and run, e.g.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jalanb/co.py.cat.git
$ cd co.py.cat
$ python3 -m copycat abc abd pqr
```

Running
-------

The program takes two `arguments`

- A pair of words with some change
  - for example "abc abd".
- A word to be changed
  - for example "pqr"

And one `option`

- How many solutions to evaluate
  - for example
    - `--solutions 10` means "try 10 solutions"
    - the default is "try 1 solution"
 

So, to find a single x for the analogy `ABC:ABD::PQR:x`

```sh
$ python3 -m copycat ABC ABD PQR
PQS: 1 (average time 0.3 seconds, average temperature 14.43)
```

Evaluating more solutions can produce output

```sh
$ python3 -m copycat ABC ABD PQQRRR --solutions 10
PQQRRRR: 2 (average time 0.65 seconds, average temperature 17.1)
PQQRRS: 5 (average time 0.82 seconds, average temperature 17.38)
PQQSSS: 3 (average time 1.29 seconds, average temperature 24.83)
```

In that run the program considered three solutions:

- `PQQRRRR` 2 times at 17˚ in 0.7 seconds
- `PQQRRS` 5 times at 17˚ in 0.8 seconds
- `PQQSSS` 3 times at 24˚ in 1.3 seconds


From that one might say "copycat liked `PQQRRRR` best" because:

1. The average temperature is lowest (`17˚` looks like the "most obvious" solution)
2. The average time is lowest (`0.7 seconds` looks like it did the least work)

On the other hand `PQQRRS` might be considered "best" because it was the accepted solution most often: 5 times.

For me: `PQQRRRR` is the "best" solution, because increasing the number of `Q`s from 3 to 4 is the "best" analogy to increasing the 3rd letter (`C`) to the 4th letter (`D`). However the other 2 answers also seem "quite good" because `PQQRRS` is the most direct (just increase the last letter), and `PQQSSS` is also fairly direct (increase letter in the last group).

This example output emphasizes that Copycat is not intended to produce a single definitive solution to an analogy problem, but to explore solutions, and try different strategies to find them. It also shows the different "levels" that Copycat considered in this problem: changing letters, or groups of letters, or both.

Note that there is no "correct" solution to an analogy problem - there are arguments to be made for each of `PQQRRRR`, `PQQRRS` and `PQQSSS` above, and only one's own preferences can decide that one of them is "best".

Importing
---------
The program can also be imported and run from within Python, e.g.

```python
>>> from copycat import copycat
>>> answers = copycat.run("abc", "abd", "pqqrrr", 10)
>>> print(answers)
{'pqqrrrr': {'avgtemp': 18.320790853668182, 'avgtime': 759.0, 'count': 1},
 'pqqrrs': {'avgtemp': 38.58653638621074, 'avgtime': 1294.1666666666667, 'count': 6},
 'pqqsss': {'avgtemp': 37.86964564086443, 'avgtime': 1642.6666666666667, 'count': 3}}
```
